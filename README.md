# Computer Science master thesis

Latex code for my computer science master thesis, "A comparison of frequentist methods and Bayesian approximations in the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks in an Active Learning setting".

Supervised by [Alfredo Garbuno IÃ±igo](https://github.com/agarbuno).

Code can be found [here](https://github.com/mariobecerra/Active_Learning_CNNs).

And the final PDF file can be found [here](https://mariobecerra.github.io/files/school_projects/msc_thesis_2019-05-11_git.pdf).


### To compile document locally

Must have `latex` and `biber` installed. Follow the following instructions:

1. Clone repository.

2. cd to `latex` directory.

3. Folder has a Makefile, so all you have to do is execute the command `make all`

### To compile document on the cloud

Go to https://v2.overleaf.com/read/dscncbsfvjvf and compile. This version may not reflect most recent changes because I have to manually pull changes from the repository and I don't do this with every single commit.

### Description of R scripts

- File `gradient_descent_example.R` implements gradient descent for logistic regression in simulated data. Generates file `GD_plots.pdf`.

- File `mini_batch_gradient_descent_example.R` implements mini-batch gradient descent for logistic regression in simulated data. Uses `mini_batch_gd_log_reg.cpp` file to compile C++ code via `Rcpp` package. Generates file `Mini-batch_GD_plots.png`.

- File `BBVI_logistic_regression.R` implements gradient ascent for Mean-field Variational Approximation of posterior distribution of logistic regression in simulated data. Generates file `BBVI_plots.pdf`.

- File `plot_ANN.R` creates ANN diagrams. Generates files `plot_ANN_01.pdf`, `plot_ANN_02.pdf` and `plot_ANN_03.pdf`.

- File `plot_KL_example.R` shows the difference between forward and reverse KL-divergence in a Gaussian mixture. Creates files `KL_example_1.pdf`, `KL_example_2.pdf` and `KL_example_3.pdf`.

- File `logistic_regression_AL_example.R` implements active learning in two logistic regression models with simulated data. Creates files `log_reg_AL_decision_boundary_plot.pdf` and `log_reg_AL_accuracies_plot.pdf`.
