Dedication:

\hfil \textit{Most books at the library will have a dedication page. Normally, this page includes quotes like `For my mother' or `For Lucy who never gave up on me.' A dissertation dedication is the same concept. In this part of the dissertation, the student must use a sentence or a paragraph to dedicate their text. They may want to use the dedication to recognize an individual who inspired them to go to college or someone who helped with the dissertation. Dedicating the dissertation to someone is a way to honor them. After putting so much work into this paper, it is a chance for the student to recognize the people who influenced the process.} \hfil
