\chapter*{\phantom{Acknowledgements}}

Acknowledgments:

In the acknowledgments section of the dissertation, students will need to recognize the professors, advisers, librarians, committee and researchers who made the dissertation possible. While some of these individuals may be directly involved in the process, others may be included in the acknowledgments for their morale support. A supportive spouse or parent may be included on occasion. Additionally, students should keep in mind all of the librarians at different archives and research assistants who helped with the research. While the committee members should be included for political reasons, the librarians and researchers should be acknowledged because they actually contributed to the completion of the dissertation.
